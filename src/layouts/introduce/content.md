Midas Foundation is a decentralized autonomous organization founded to empower Midas Pioneers, Midasians and other stakeholders in our ecosystem. Midas Foundation is essentially a web-based platform for Midasians and Midas Pioneers to invest in Frontier Tech projects, aiming at projects that help global adoption of many new technologies through assisting startups to raise fund and provide passive income for all, is one key pillar of our Midas Ecosystem.

Midas Foundation has been kickstarting potential frontier technology projects, providing reliable information and validating projects according to Global Transparency Alliance Framework. Midas Foundation is dedicated to bring the most of benefits and rewards to Midas Pioneers & Midasians as well as to grow and protect their investments in Midas Ecosystem. The ultimate objective of Midas Foundation is to innovate in such a way that it can provide passive income and smart investment opportunities to the Pioneers through rewards/airdrops from those projects that are supported by the Foundation.
As a Vietnam blockchain advocate, we are collaborating with BigBom to offer BBO Long-term Incentive Program for the same above objective.

## SMART CONTRACT
The whole program will be control from a Ethereum smart contract. After the activation from Midas Foundation, the program will have 100% autonomy, according to the smart contract code. Midas Foundation and other parties have to rights to change any of its internal value, or changing the contract logic. The contract address is

`0x239dE3a0D6ca5f21601f83327eA2174225eB7156`

Our contract has been source code certified by etherscan.io and we expect the community to do a deep review. The program is entirely voluntary, and everything is based on the code. Participants are aware of the risks of the contract code .

## RULES
1. The long-term incentive program started on **November 25, 2018 - 10:00am (UTC time)**.
2. The program's participation will be open for 60 days, ending on **January 25, 2019 - 10:00pm (UTC time)**. Any tokens deposited after this time will be donated to the Midas Foundation.
3. Midas Foundation has already deposited 10 million BBO tokens into the smart contract as the initial reward. With the participation of more benefactors, the number of tokens will increase at any time. The Foundation may choose to deposit any BBO at any time.
4. **All BBOs transferred to the incentive plan contract through direct transfer will be part of the award and cannot be taken back. If you do not want to contribute BBO for free, please do not directly transfer any BBO to the contract address. Bear in mind that if you really transfer the BBO directly to the incentive plan, we are not able to help you recover your tokens.** You must authorize and confirm the transfer first (instructions below). Please follow each step carefully as the Foundation will not be able to recover your tokens if any mistakes are made.
5. Participants may not withdraw their BBO tokens for 12 months from the date of their original token deposit(s). The token withdraw period will open from the 18th month to 24th month. Participants may withdraw their tokens in partial or in full during this time. Any tokens still remaining in the program after the 24th month will be donated to the Foundation.
6. You can check the timing of your withdrawal on our website at https://bigbomio.github.io/hodl. However, you are solely responsible for tracking the timing of your withdrawal eligibility period as you will not receive any reminders from the Foundation.
7. There are no fees associated with participating in this program.
8. The total number of BBO tokens deposited by investors will not be capped. There are no minimum restriction as well.
 
> The Midas Foundation reserves the right of final decision on the interpretation of the program rules. Please be sure to review this page and its instructions carefully before participating in the program.

## RATE OF RETURNS & BONUS DISTRIBUTION SCHEME
It is our estimation that 50m of BBO will be deposited into the long-term incentive contract. With 10m of initial reward from Midas Foundation, we can estimate the rate of returns as below

### RATE OF RETURNS = TOTAL REWARDS / TOTAL DEPOSITED TOKENS

Using the estimated number, the calculation will be: **10,000,000/50,000,000 = 20% returns**

Another benefit from this program is the rate of return may increase if tokens are held longer than the minimum 12 months holding period. The longer you hold ( up to 24 months), the higher the estimated rate of return.

We also will provide the ability to check the current return via smart contract url at etherscan.io or on our program home page https://bigbomio.github.io/hodl.
